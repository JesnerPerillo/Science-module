	<p class="pers">Earth and space science (ESS) is about Earth and its place within the solar<br> system and universe. It includes the study of the Earth's land, 	oceans,<br> atmosphere, and all the life that lives there from animals to plants.<br> It includes the water cycle, the carbon cycle, the rock cycle, and anything<br> that 	gradually affects the Earth over time.But that's the ''Earth'' part of<br> earth and space science. The ''space'' part talks about the Earth's position<br> in the solar 	system, and it also explores the solar system and universe as a<br> whole. Understanding the wider universe helps us get a sense of Earth's place.<br>
	When studying earth and space science, you might find yourself talking about<br> the deepest oceans or the farthest reaches of the galaxy. You might be talking<br> about 	plants and animals, or humans blasting off into space in rockets.<br> The study covers a wide variety of topics.<br>Earth and space science explores the interconnections 	between the land, ocean,<br> atmosphere, and life of our planet. These include the cycles of water, carbon,<br> rock, and other materials that continuously shape, 	influence, and sustain Earth<br> and its inhabitants.</p>
