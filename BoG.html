	<hr color="gray" width="70%" align="right" class="hr">

	<p class="text">The behavior of gases is a fascinating subject of study in the field of physics<br> and chemistry. Gases, which are one of the three states of matter 	along with<br> liquids and solids, are composed of particles that are in constant motion and<br> have no definite shape or volume. The behavior of gases is governed by a 	set of<br> physical laws that describe their properties, such as pressure, volume,<br> temperature, and the number of particles present. Understanding the behavior of<br> 	gases is crucial in many scientific and industrial applications, from the design<br> of combustion engines to the study of atmospheric phenomena. In this 	introduction,<br> we will explore some of the fundamental concepts that underpin the behavior of<br> gases and the importance of this area of study.</p>

	<p class="normal-text">Gases are a state of matter characterized by the absence of a definite shape or volume, and the behavior of gases is governed by a set of physical 	laws that describe the relationships between properties such as pressure, volume, and temperature. Understanding the behavior of gases under pressure is crucial in many 	scientific and industrial applications.</p>

	<p class="text-title"> Gases and its Mass </p>
	<p class="normal-text">Gases are a state of matter characterized by their ability to expand and fill any container they are placed in. Unlike liquids and solids, gases 	have no definite shape or volume. The atoms or molecules in a gas are typically in constant random motion and collide with each other and with the walls of the container 	they are in. The mass of a gas depends on several factors, including the number of atoms or molecules in the gas, the temperature, the pressure, and the volume. The ideal 	gas law, which relates these factors, is expressed as PV=nRT, where P is the pressure of the gas, V is the volume, n is the number of moles of gas, R is the gas constant, 	and T is the temperature in Kelvin. The mass of a gas can be calculated using the ideal gas law by multiplying the number of moles of gas (n) by its molar mass. The molar 	mass is the mass of one mole of the gas and is typically expressed in grams per mole. The mass of a gas can also be determined experimentally by weighing the container 	before and after the gas is added, and then subtracting the mass of the container.</p>
	
	<p class="text-title">Gases and its Volume </p>
	<p class="normal-text">Gas is one of the states of matter, which is characterized by having no definite shape or volume, and it can easily expand and contract to fill the 	available space. In other words, gases take the shape and volume of their container. The volume of a gas is determined by the amount of space it occupies. The volume of a 	gas can be measured using a variety of units such as liters, cubic meters, or milliliters. The volume of a gas depends on the temperature, pressure, and the number of 	particles (atoms or molecules) present in the gas. The relationship between the volume of a gas and its pressure and temperature is described by the ideal gas law. The 	ideal gas law equation is PV = nRT, where P is the pressure of the gas, V is its volume, n is the number of moles of gas, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature 	in Kelvin. This equation shows that the volume of a gas is directly proportional to the number of moles of gas present and the temperature, and inversely proportional to 	the pressure. Therefore, as the temperature of a gas increases, its volume also increases, and as the pressure of a gas increases, its volume decreases, assuming that the 	number of particles and the gas constant remain constant.</p>

	<p class="text-title">Gases and its Temperature </p>
	<p class="normal-text">The temperature of a gas is a measure of the average kinetic energy of its particles. The kinetic energy of a gas particle is related to its motion 	and is directly proportional to its temperature. At higher temperatures, the particles of a gas move faster and collide with each other and with the walls of their 	container with greater force. The temperature of a gas can be measured using different scales, such as Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. The Kelvin scale is the most 	commonly used scale for measuring temperature in scientific applications, as it is an absolute temperature scale that is based on the theoretical concept of zero kelvin 	(0 K), which represents the lowest possible temperature, at which all molecular motion would cease. The behavior of gases is described by the ideal gas law, which relates 	the pressure, volume, temperature, and number of particles of a gas. According to the ideal gas law, the volume of a gas is directly proportional to the temperature of 	the gas, assuming the pressure and the number of particles of the gas remain constant. Therefore, if the temperature of a gas is increased, its volume will also increase, 	and if the temperature of a gas is decreased, its volume will also decrease, assuming the other variables remain constant.</p>

	<p class="text-title">Gases and its Pressure </p>
	<p class="normal-text">The pressure of a gas is the force per unit area that the gas exerts on the walls of its container. It is caused by the collisions of gas particles 	with the walls of the container. The pressure of a gas can be measured using units such as pascals (Pa), atmospheres (atm), or pounds per square inch (psi). The behavior 	of gases is described by the ideal gas law, which states that the pressure, volume, temperature, and number of particles of a gas are related. The ideal gas law can be 	expressed as PV = nRT, where P is the pressure of the gas, V is its volume, n is the number of moles of gas, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin. 	According to the ideal gas law, the pressure of a gas is inversely proportional to its volume, assuming that the temperature and number of particles remain constant. This 	means that if the volume of a gas is decreased while the temperature and the number of particles remain constant, the pressure of the gas will increase, and vice versa. 	Similarly, if the temperature of a gas is increased while the volume and the number of particles remain constant, the pressure of the gas will also increase, and vice 	versa. This relationship between pressure and volume is known as Boyle's law.</p>

	<p class="text-title1"> Relationship between pressure and volume of gases </p>
	<p class="text">The relationship between the volume and pressure of gases at constant temperature<br> was first stated by Robert Boyle during the 16th century. He 	performed an<br> experiment wherein he trapped a fixed amount of air in the J-tube, he changed the<br> pressure and controlled the temperature and then, he observed its 	effect to the<br> volume of the air inside the J-tube. He found out that as the pressure is increased,<br> the volume decreases. He finally concluded that the volume of a 	fixed amount of gas<br> is inversely proportional to its pressure at constant temperature.</p>

	<p class="text-title"> Relationship between temperature and volume of gases </p>
	<p class="text">The volume temperature relationship in gases (k = V/T) was determined by and named<br> after Jacques Charles. In his experiment, Jacques Charles trapped a 	sample of gas<br> in a cylinder with a movable piston in water bath at different temperatures. Jacques<br> Charles found out that different gases decreased their volume 	by factors 1/273 per<br> °C of cooling. With this rate of reduction, if gas will be cooled up to -273°C, it<br> will have zero volume! Interesting, isn't it? Charles' Law 	states that at constant<br> pressure, the volume of a fixed amount of gas is directly proportional to the Kelvin<br> (K) temperature.</p>

	<p class="text-title"> Relationship between temperature-pressure and volume of gases </p>
	<p class="text">he person who is credited with the determination of the temperature-pressure<br> relationship in gases at constant volume is Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac. He 	deduced that<br> the pressure of the gas is directly proportional to its temperature. his means that<br> when the temperature of gases increases its pressure also 	increases or vice versa.<br> Hence, we can state the Gay-Lussac's Law as: At constant volume, the pressure of a<br> fixed mass of gas is directly proportional to the 	absolute temperature.</p>

	<p class="text-title"> Equal Volumes of all gases </p>
	<p class="text">During the first half of the nineteenth century, Lorenzo Romano Amedeo Carlo Avogadro,<br> Count of Quaregna and Cerreto, made important contributions in 	shedding light on<br> reaction stoichiometry. He provided explanations as to why compounds reacted in<br> definite ratios and on how the amount of gas affects its volume. 	Experimentally, the<br> most convenient way of quantifying the amount of gas is through its mass. Avogadro<br> played an important role in providing evidence of the 	existence of atoms. Eventually<br> the number of molecules in a mole is named after him.</p>
	<img src="avogadro.jpg" alt="Lorenzo Romano Amedeo Carlo Avogadro" class="avogadro">
	<p class="normal-text"> &nbspIn 1811, Avogadro wrote in a paper that, "Equal volumes of all gases, kept at the same pressure and temperature, contain the same number of 	molecules. Avogadro was the first to suggest that the volume of a gas is directly proportional to the number of moles of gas present at a given temperature and 	pressure.</p>

	<p class="text-title">Summary</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Gas is one of the phases of matter. It has no definite shape and size. It can be compressed easily.</li>
	<li>Properties of gases include mass, volume, temperature, and pressure.</li>
	<li>The amount of a gas or its mass could be expressed in moles or grams. The mass of gases is negligible.</li>
	<li>he volume of a gas is the amount of space occupied by the gases. Gases have the tendency to occupy all the spaces of the container that they are confined. They have weak intermolecular force of attraction; hence they are arranged as far away as possible from each other. The common units used in expressing the volume of a gas are liter (L) and milliliter (mL).</li>
	<li>The temperature of a gas is the measure of the hotness or coldness of an object. It is proportional to the average kinetic energy of its molecules. It can be measured in Celsius or Kelvin. Kelvin is the absolute scale.</li>
	<li>The pressure of a confined gas is the average effect of the forces of the colliding molecules. It can be measured in atmosphere, torr, psi, cmHg or mmHg. It can be quantified using this equation:</li>
	<p class="normal-text"> P = F/A<br>Where: P = pressure, F = force, and A = Area</p>
	<p class="normal-text"> F = ma<br>Where: F = force, m = mass and a = acceleration</p>
	<li>The properties of gases can affect one another. They are related to each other.</li>
	<li>The volume of a gas is directly related to its temperature at constant pressure.</li>
	<li>The pressure of a gas is directly related to its temperature at constant temperature.</li>

	<li>The amount of a gas in a mole is directly related to its volume at constant pressure and temperature.</li>
	<li>The properties of gases can be varied. The relationships of these properties can be quantified experimentally with the aid of the different laboratory apparatus or by using the different gas laws as follows:</li>

	<li>Not all gases behave ideally. Most of the gases found in nature conform to the principles of Boyle’s Law, Charles’ Law, Gay-Lussac’s Law, Avogadro’s Law, and Combined Gas Law.</li>
	<li>The following conversion factors are useful in solving gas law related problems:</li>

	<p class="normal-text">b. For pressure<br> 1 atm = 760 mmHg = 76 cmHg = 760 torr = 101,325 Pa = 14.6956 psi</p>
	<p class="normal-text">x. For temperature<br> 0°C = 273.15K &nbsp&nbsp 0°C = 32°F</p>
	<li>The behavior of the gas molecules can be explained by the Kinetic Molecular Theory. It states that:</li>
	 <ol type="A">
	 <li>Gases are composed of molecules. The distances from molecule to molecule are far greater than the molecules’ dimensions. These molecules can be considered as spherical bodies which possess negligible mass and volume.</li>
	 <li>Gas molecules are always in constant random motion and they frequently collide with each other and with the walls of the container. Collisions among molecules are perfectly elastic, that is, energy may transfer from molecule to molecule as the result of collision, but the total energy of all the molecules in the system remains the same/constant.</li>
	<li>There is a negligible attractive or repulsive force between or among gas molecules.</li>
	<li>Movement of gas molecules is affected by temperature. The average kinetic of the molecules is directly related to the temperature of gas.</li>
