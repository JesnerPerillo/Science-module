	<p class="text">An ecosystem is a community of living organisms and their physical environment,<br> including the air, water, and soil in which they interact. 	Biodiversity, on the<br> other hand, refers to the variety of living organisms that exist in an ecosystem.<br> Ecosystem biodiversity refers to the range and variety of 	species that coexist<br> within a particular ecosystem, and the interrelationships between those species.<br> A diverse ecosystem is one that contains a large number of 	different species, each<br> with its own unique characteristics, behaviors, and roles within the ecosystem.<br> Biodiversity is essential to the health and functioning of 	ecosystems. Each species<br> plays a crucial role in maintaining the balance of the ecosystem, and a loss of<br> 	even a single species can have significant impacts on 	the rest of the system.<br> For example, if a predator species were to disappear from an ecosystem, the prey<br> species would likely overpopulate and cause imbalances in 	the food chain.<br> Overall, ecosystem biodiversity is a vital aspect of our planet's health and<br> well-being, and its preservation is critical for the survival of both 	individual<br> species and entire ecosystems.</p>

	<p class="text-title"> Biodiversity and Stability </p>
	<p class="normal-text"> Biodiversity is a term that describes how varied living things are in a specific are. How many kinds of living things can be found in your 	community? Think about a place in your community; try to identify organisms that can be found in your locality and are valuable to your life. Why do you consider those 	organisms important to you?<br><br> &nbspOrganisms are part of biodiversity and may be economicallyand ecologically valuable. Their products are source of food, medecine, 	clothing, shelter, and energy. These organisms are also important in maintaining balance in the ecosystem as they performing their specific roles. Some species maintain 	the quality of natural bodies of water; some prevent soil erosion and floods, cycle minerals in the soil and absorb pollutants. Others feed on the insects and pests which 	control the polution of organisms in a certain environment, thus making the ecosystem balance and stable.</p>

	<p class="text-title"> The value of species can be divided into various categories: </p>
	<ol>
	 <li>Direct economic value</li>
	  <p class="normal-text">The species is considered to have direct economic value if their products are sources of food, medicine, clothing, shelter, and energy. For 	example, some medicines being used nowadays have formulations extracted from plants or animals. Vinblastine and vincristine are two chemicals that have been extracted 	from rosy periwinkle (tsitsirika in Tagalog) and are used in chemotherapy for Hodgkin's disease and some form of cancer, including lymphocytic leukemia. Another common 	plant, Vitex negundo (lagundi) is extracted for cough syrup production.</p>
	 <li>Indirect economic value</li>
	  <p class="normal-text">A species has an indirect economic value if there are benefits produced by the organism without using them. For example, certain species maintain 	the chemical quality of natural bodies of water, prevent soil erosion and floods, cycle materials in the soil, and absorb pollutants.</p>
	 <li>Aestetic value</li>
	  <p class="normal-text">A lot of species provides visual or artistic enjoyment, like a forested landscape and the calming beauty of a natural park; or they may be used 	for spiritual meditation like the Prayer Mountains.</p>
	</ol>

	<p class="text-title"> The Ups and Downs of Population Growth </p>
	<p class="normal-text">A population is a group of organisms of the same species that live in a certain area. Ecologists regularly monitor the number of organisms in many 	populations, but why do they do this? Why should we care if the number of organisms in an area is increasing or decreasing? Well, populations that are growing or 	diminishing can be indicators of potential problems in the organisms' environment, and such conditions alarm the ecologists if something is going wrong. But it is not 	enough to simply know if the number of organisms in an area is increasing or decreasing: ecologists need to know why the number of organisms is decreasing. So, one of the 	main questions ecologists ask themselves is this: Why is a population's size increasing or decreasing?<br>

	There are many factors that can cause a population's size to change. But first, you must understand the basic reasons behind why a population increases or decreases. Any 	population, whether it be that of humans, animals, the mold growing on bread, or the bacteria living in your intestines, will grow if more organisms are being developed 	(Genetically modified organisms), or born, than are dying. The number of births in a population is called the birth rate (natality). The number of organisms that are 	dying in a population is called the death rate (moratlity). Thus, if the birth rate is greater than the death rate, a population will grow. If the death rate is greater 	than the birth rate, then the population will decrease.</p>

	<p class="text">While populations would probably to continue to grow in size, a population of<br> organisms cannot grow forever-its growth will be limited, or stopped, at 	some<br> point, and the death rate will be greater than the birth rate. A population's<br> growth is limited by two general factors: density-independent factors and<br> 	density- dependent factors.<br>
	To understand why scientists named these factors in the way they did. Sample<br> Population Density of you must first understand the concept of people in a<br> certain 	community population density. Population density refers to the number<br> of organisms per unit area. If a population's density is very high, that means<br> there are a 	lot of organisms crowded into a certain area. If a population's<br> density is low, that means there are very few organisms in an area.<br>
	A factor that regulates a population's growth and is influenced by population<br> density, is called density-dependent limiting factor. If the population's<br> density d	oes not directly influence changes in population's growth, then it is<br> called a density-independent limiting factor.</p>
	<img src="population.gif" alt="Population" class="population">

	<p class="normal-text">Density-independent limiting factors that can stop a population from growing can be such things as natural disasters, temperature, sunlight, and 	the activities of humans in the environment. Natural disasters such as tropical cyclones, floods, earthquakes and fires will stop a population from growing no matter how 	many organisms are living in a certain area. The same goes for the temperature of an area and the amount of sunlight it receives. If the temperature increases due to 	global warming, this will cause a decrease in a population's numbers, no matter how large or small the population was to begin with. Human activities that alter the 	environment will also decrease the number of organisms in a population, regardless of the size of a population.<br>
	Density-dependent limiting factors come into play when a population reaches a certain number of organisms. For example, when a population reaches a certain size, there 	won't be enough resources (food, shelter, water) for all of the organisms. This could cause the population to stop growing when it reaches the maximum number of organisms 	that can be supported, or "carried," by the environment. This number is known as the population's carrying capacity in a particular environment. Each population of 	organisms has a different carrying capacity, depending on the amount of resources available in the area in which It lives.</p>

	<p class="text-title"> Limiting Factors that depend on population density </p>
	<ol>
	<li>Diseases and parasites</li>
	<p class="normal-text">Infectious diseases and parasites spread faster in densely populated areas.</p>
	<li>Competition for resources</li>
	<p class="normal-text">Organism with better adaptations to obtain (food) resources will be able to reproduce more often, and its population will grow. The organisms that 	have limited abilities to compete for the resources will not reproduce as often, may not be fit enough to live long, and can cause their population to decrease.</p>
	<li>Predation</li>
	<p class="normal-text">Plenty of prey are available, predators will be able to eat sufficiently, thus have energy to reproduce much, and increase their numbers. The 	population of their prey will begin to decrease as more and more of them are eaten. However, the predator population will eventually reach carrying capacity-there will 	not be enough prey for all of the predators in the population, since the predators themselves compete for their "prey" resource. As the number of prey decreases, so will 	the number of predators, because there is not enough food to sustain them.</p>
	<li>Emigration</li>
	<p class="normal-text">Emigration occurs when, as a population approaches its carrying capacity, and individual organisms leave and go to a new area where they can find 	enough resources for survival and reproduction. This will obviously cause a decrease in the amount of organisms in a population.</p>
	</ol>

	<p class="text-title">Environmental Problems and Issues</p>
	<p class="normal-text">The Philippines is considered as one of the biologically richest country in the world because of its high biodiversity at various levels. Our 	country has both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, and also a high degree of endemism, meaning high numbers of native species of flora and fauna are found only in 	tropical communities.<br>
	We have all these rich natural biological resources but we have not truly protected them. We are losing this global heritage due to habitat destruction, overuse and 	pollution. As our forests are destroyed at a fast rate, the natural habitats which are dwelling places of plant and animal species are also lost. Our coral reefs, where 	the fishes lay eggs, are badly damaged by destructive fishing methods such as muro-ami, dynamite and fine nets in fishing. In addition, people hunt animals, collect 	plants, and sell corals and exotic animals for livelihood, and other activities that cause the population of these organisms to decrease at a faster rate. Hence, in view 	of these harmful human activities, our country is also noted in the world as a hot spot for conservation and protection of species.<br>
	The rate of development in some parts of the country is extraordinary. The natural landscape has been changed by tall buildings, establishments, housing projects, 	expressways, railway systems and overpasses. Other reclaimed areas have been converted into industrial structures and techno parks.</p>
