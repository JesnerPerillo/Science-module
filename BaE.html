	<hr color="gray" width="70%" align="right" class="hr">

	<p class="text">Biodiversity and evolution are two closely related concepts that are fundamental<br> to our understanding of life on Earth. Biodiversity refers to the 	variety of<br> life forms that exist on our planet, including the diversity of species, genes,<br> and ecosystems. Evolution, on the other hand, refers to the process by 	which<br> different species have emerged over time, as a result of genetic changes and<br> adaptations to different environments.<br>

	The relationship between biodiversity and evolution is complex and interconnected.<br> Evolutionary processes, such as natural selection, are responsible for the<br> 	diversity of life on Earth. As species evolve and adapt to different environments,<br> they become more diverse and specialized, leading to the emergence of new 	species<br> and the expansion of biodiversity.<br>

	At the same time, biodiversity is also essential for evolution to occur. The more<br> diverse a population or ecosystem, the greater the potential for genetic 	variation<br> and the emergence of new traits and adaptations. This can lead to the evolution of<br> new species and the expansion of biodiversity.<br>

	Overall, biodiversity and evolution are closely intertwined, with each concept<br> influencing and shaping the other. Understanding the relationship between<br> 	biodiversity and evolution is crucial for our understanding of the natural world<br> and for developing effective strategies for conserving and managing biodiversity<br> 	in the face of global environmental change.</p>

	<p class="text-title">Sources of Evidence for Evolution </p>
	<p class="normal-text"> Organisms inhabiting the earth have changed overtime, their structures, traits, and abilities allowed them to adapt and survive in their 	environment. Data from the fossil records, anatomy and morphology, embryonic development and biochemistry could be analyzed to demonstrate if evolution of life on earth 	has taken place.</p>
	<p class="text-title"> Evidence from Fossil Records </p>
	<p class="normal-text">Have you ever seen fossils of any organism? Fossils are examples of evidences that paleontologists use in studying evolution. They are traces of 	organisms that lived in the past and wew preserved by natural process or catastropic events. They can be remains of organisms which include bones, shells, teeth and also 	feces embedded in rocks, peat, resin, and ice. Paleontologist is a person who studies fossils.</p>
	
	<p class="fossil-title">Most fossils were commonly found in sedimentary rocks. They were from the hardesd parts of the organism like woody stem, bones, or teeth.</p>

	<p class="fossil-title">Another type of fossil is an important or impression. Imprints are shallow external molds left by animal or plant tissues with little or no 	organic materials present. Compression is the other side with more organic material.</p>

	<p class="text-title1">Hint of Evolution from Comparative Anatomy </p>
	<p class="normal-text">Another hint of Evolutionary concept is from the comparative anatomy. Structures from different species which have similar internal framework, 	position, and embryonic development are considered to be homologous. <br><br>&nbsp Homologous structures may perform different functions in the species living in the 	different environment, or it may have the same origin but different functions.</p>

	<img src="forelimbs.jpeg" alt="Forelimbs of Human,horse,cat,bat,bird,whale" class="forelimbs">
	<p class="forelimbs-text"> Here are some example of homologous structures: forelimbs of Human, Horse, Cat, Bat, Bird, Whale, which are structurally the same, but 	functionally different. <br><br> &nbspStructures of unrelated species may evolve to look alike, because the structure is adapted to similar function. These are called 	analogous structures. Analogous structures have similar functions but different origin.</p>

	<img src="birds.jpeg" alt="Birds" class="birds">
	<p class="birds-text">Examples are wings of birds, bats, and insects that have the same function but different in origin.</p>

	<p class="text-title"> Divergent Evolution </p>
	<p class="text"> The presence of homologous structure is a strong indicator that the organisms<br> evolved from common ancestors. This type of evolution is called 	divergent evolution.<br>
	Divergent evolution is the splitting of an ancestral population into two or more<br> sub-populations that are geographically isolated from ano another.</p>

	<p class="text-title"> Convergent Evolution </p>
	<p class="text"> Convergence is an increase in similarities among species derived from different<br> ancestors as a result of similar adaptation to similar 	environment.<br> In convergent evolution, analogous structures of unrelated organisms from different<br> ancestors develop similar functions such as butterfly wings and 	bird wings.</p>
	<img src="conV.jpg" alt="Convergent Evolution Example" class="conV">

	<p class="text-title"> Evidence from Embryonic Development </p>
	<p class="normal-text"> An embreyo is an early stage of development in organisms. Embryonic development include stages such as blastula, gastrula, and organogenesis. The 	embryo of fishes, salamanders, lizards, birds, cats, and humans are similar during the first stages of their embryonic development; and have several homologous structures 	that are mot present when the organisms are adults.<br> Studies show that species that are closely related exhibit similar embryonic development. Even when in the adult 	stage, the organisms are quite different.<br>

	<p class="text-title"> Theories of Evolution </p>
	<p class="text"> Jean Baptiste de Lamarck was the first evolutionist to believe that organisms change<br> over time. Using fossil records as a guide, Lamarck was able to 	develop three<br> theories; one is The Theory of Need which states that organisms change in response to<br> their environment. Their ability to survive helped them 	develop characteristics<br> necessary for them to adapt in a given environment. Next is the Theory of Use and<br> Disuse; which according to Lamarck, organds no in use 	will disappear while organs in<br> use will develop. lamarck believed that giraffes before have short necks, but because<br> of the need to survive and in order to reach 	tall trees for food, they kept stretching<br> their necks until it becames longer and able to reach taller trees.</p>
	<img src="jean.jpg" alt="Jean Baptiste de Lamarck" class="jean">
	<p class="normal-text"> These acquired characteristics were believed to be inherited by their offsprings and propagated by the next generation of giraffes. Lamarck called 	it as The Teory of Acquired Characteristics.<br><br> &nbspIf you change the color of your hair from balck to blond, do you think your child can enherit the blond color of 	your hair? A young lady keeps on using whitening soap and becomes fair? Can her children inherit her acquired fairness?<br><br> &nbspMany scientists rejected the theories 	of Lamarck. They understood that if wew changes in cell or body structure, there could be changes in the genetic information of the species.</p>

	<p class="text-title"> Darwinian Theory </p>
	<p class="text"> The more popular Theory of Evolution proposed by Charles Darwin based on natural<br> selection is different from the theories of Lamarck. According to 	Darwin, giraffe<br> species originally had varying neck lengths but natural selection favored the survival<br> of giraffes with longer necks that could feed on taller 	trees that wew available.<br> Giraffes with whort neck were eliminated due to lack of accessible food supply. Fifty<br> years adter Lamarck's Theory of Use and Disuse, 	Charles Darwin suggested the Theory of<br> Natural Selection, after his voyage to the Galapagos Island in HMS Beagle. He was<br> fascinated by the diversity of organisms 	he found along the journey.</p>
	<img src="darwin.jpg" alt="Charles Darwin" class="darwin">

	<p class="text"> &nbspIn Galapagos Island, he observed that finch species have different beak structures<br> for different food types. The abundance of certain finch 	species in an island was<br> somehow related to the type of available food for these birds.</p>
	<img src="darwintheory.webp" alt="Darwin's Theory" class="darwintheory">

	<p class="text"> &nbspDarwin suggested that selection also takes place in nature. In selective breeding,<br> farmer identifies and selects the best and desirable trait to 	propagate. In natural<br> selection, environmental factors promote the survival of the fittest and eliminates<br> the less fit.</p>
