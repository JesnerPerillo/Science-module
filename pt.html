	<p class="des">&nbsp Our country is blessed with so many land features such as mountains
	and volcanoes. These features can be sources of different minerals or can be
	used for agricultural purposes. For example, we have the majestic and world
	renowned Mayon Volcano. Because of its activity, it produces fertile slopes
	and plains which are used by the locals to grow their crops. Also, found in the
	northeastern coast of Luzon, we have the Sierra Madre mountain range which
	is home to many endemic species of flora and fauna.</p>
	<p class="dess"> We will study thoroughly the framework that will enable us
	to understand <br> how and why several features of the Earth continuously change.<br>
	This theory is what we call “Plate Tectonics.”<br>
	This describes the events within the Earth that give rise to mountain<br>
	ranges, volcanoes, earthquake belts, and other features of the Earth’s surface.</p>

	<p class="text-title"> What is Plate Tectonics? </p>
	<p class="platee">As shown in Figure, there are seven relatively large plates and a
	number <br> of smaller ones, including the Philippine plate. The plates move very
	slowly <br> but constantly, and this movement is called tectonics; thus the theory of <br>
	moving lithospheric plates is called plate tectonics.
	Before we study more<br> about plate tectonics, let’s discuss first one of
	the consequences of moving<br> crustal plates which is crucial in studying plate
	tectonics: earthquake.<br> An earthquake releases
	three types of seismic waves; Primary (P-waves),<br> Secondary (S-waves), and
	Long surface waves (L-waves). The first two travel<br> into the Earth’s interior
	while the last one on the surface. These waves<br> travel at different velocities;
	thus, do not arrive at a seismic recording<br> station at the same time. The farther
	the recording instrument is from the<br> focus, the greater the difference in arrival
	times of the first P-wave<br> compared to the first S-wave. The difference in the
	arrival time will tell<br> us the distance of the earthquake’s focus from the seismic
	recording station.<br> However, it does not tell in which direction it came from.</p>

	<p class="normal-text">If we have at least three recording stations that can tell how far away
	from them the earthquake occurred, the epicenter can be determined using the
	triangulation method. It uses distance information from three seismic stations
	to locate the earthquake epicenter. On a map, circles are drawn around each
	seismic station. The radii of the circles are scaled to the estimated distance
	from the station to the earthquake. The three circles will intersect at one point
	that locates the earthquake.</p>

	<p class="text-title"> Types of Plate Bounderies </p>
	<p class="platees">Studying plate boundaries is important because along these boundaries
	deformation<br> of the lithosphere is happening. These geologic events have a
	great impact not<br> only on the environment but also on us.<br>
	There are three distinct types of plate boundaries, which are differentiated
	by<br> the type of movement they exhibit.<br>
	The first type of plate boundary is termed divergent boundary wherein
	plates move<br> apart, creating a zone of tension. Can you identify adjacent plates
	depicting<br> divergent boundary in the picture.<br>
	Let’s take the case of the Philippine plate and the Eurasian plate. You
	will<br> notice that the two plates are moving toward each other. This is an example
	of a<br> zone where plates collide, and this second type of plate boundary is called<br>
	convergent plate boundary.<br>
	The third type is the transform fault boundary where plates slide or grind
	past<br> each other without diverging or converging. The best example of this plate
	boundary<br> is the San Andreas fault which is bounded by the North American
	plate and the<br> Pacific plate.</p>

	<p class="text-title">Converging Oceanic Crust Leading Plate and Continental Crust Leading Plate </p>
	<p class="normal-text">The previous activity depicts what happens during collision of two plates; one has continental edge while the other has an oceanic edge. From the 	diagram, it is clear that this event gives rise to the formation of a volcanic arc near the edge of a continental leading plate. The reason for this is because the denser 	oceanic crust (PlateA) undergoes what we call subduction process or the bending of the crust towards the mantle. Since the mantle is hotter than the crust, the tendency 	is, the subducted crust melt forming magma. Addition of volatile material such as water will cause the magma to become less dense, hence allowing it to rise and reach the 	crust once again and causing volcanic activities on the continental leading plate. For the oceanic crust, one important geologic feature is formed, and that is the 	trench. Also called submarine valleys, ocean trenches are the deepest part of the ocean. One of the deepest is the Philippine trench with a depth of 10 540 meters.
	Another subsequent effect of the continuous grinding of plates against each other is the occurrence of earthquakes. The subduction of plate can cause earthquakes at 	varying depths. Most parts of the world experience occasional shallow earthquakes – where the focus is within 60 km of the Earth’s surface. Of the total energy released 	by earthquakes, 85% comes from shallow earthquakes. Meanwhile, about 12% of energy originates from intermediate earthquakes or those quakes with a focal depth range of 60 	to 300 km. Lastly, are the deep earthquakes whose origin is more than 300 km to 700 km below the Earth’s surface.</p>

	<p class="text-title">Convergence of Oceanic Plates </p>
	<p class="text">Like the first type of convergent boundaries discussed earlier, converging oceanic<br> plates will cause formation of trenches, and these trenches will 	become sources of<br> earthquakes. Underwater earthquakes, especially the stronger ones, can generate<br> tsunamis. The Japanese term for “harbor wave,” tsunami is a 	series of ocean waves<br> with very long wavelengths (typically hundreds of kilometers) caused by large-scale<br> disturbances of the ocean. The leading edge of the 	subducted plate will eventually<br> reach the mantle causing it to melt and turn into magma. The molten material will<br> rise to the surface creating a volcanic island 	arc parallel to the trench. Volcanic<br> island arc is a chain of volcanoes position in an arc shape as seen in figure below.</p>

	<p class="text-title">Formation of the Philippine Archipelago</p>
	<p class="text">Many parts of the Philippines originated from oceanic-oceanic convergence. This<br> resulted from the collision of two oceanic plates, with one of
	the plates diving<br> under the other. Majority of the islands in the Philippine archipelago are<br> considered as part of the Philippine Mobile Belt. These islands were 	formed<br> 65 million years ago at the southern edge of the Philippine Sea Plate and are<br> considered as part of island arcs. Other parts of the Philippines, such as 	Palawan,<br> Mindoro, and the Zamboanga Peninsula are all highland sections of the Sundaland block<br> of the Eurasian plate.</p>
	<img src="ph.jpg" alt="Formation of the Philippine Archipelago" class="ph">

	<p class="normal-text">Aside from the formation of trenches and troughs, the downward movement of oceanic lithospheres underneath the Philippine Archipelago creates 	active volcanic chains. For example, the descent of the West Philippine Sea oceanic lithosphere along the Manila Trench created a volcanic chain from Taiwan to Mindoro. 	Some of the known active volcanoes in this chain are Pinatubo in Central Luzon and Taal in Batangas. Also, the constant dipping movement of slabs induces frequent 	moderate to strong earthquakes at various depths, gives rise to mountain ranges and develops the geologic character of the Philippine Archipelago.</p>

	<p class="text-title">Divergence of Plates</p>
	<p class="normal-text">Formation of rift valleys and oceanic ridges are indications that the crust is spreading or splitting apart. In this case, the plates are forming 	divergent plate boundaries wherein they tend to move apart. Most divergent boundaries are situated along underwater mountain ranges called oceanic ridges. As the plates 	separate, new materials from the mantle ooze up to fill the gap. These materials will slowly cool to produce new ocean floor. The spreading rate at these ridges may vary 	from 2 to 20 cm per year. Although a very slow process, divergence of plates ensures a continuous supply of new materials from the mantle. The Mid-Atlantic Ocean ridge is 	an example of spreading center which causes the divergence of the South American plate and the African plate.</p>

	<p class="text-title">Transform Fault Boundaries </p>
	<p class="text">If the blocks of wood in Activity 6 were to represent the lithospheric plates, you<br> will notice that there were two sets of divergent plate boundaries 	(between blocks<br> 1 and 2, and blocks 3 and 4). But since the plates were adjacent to each other, a<br> new type of boundary is manifested and that is the transform 	fault boundary. Most<br> transform faults join two segments of a mid-ocean ridge (represented by the gaps<br> between 1 and 2, and between 3 and 4). Remember that the 	presence of a ridge is an<br> indication of diverging plates, and as the plates diverge between the two segments<br> of the mid-ocean ridge, the adjacent slabs of crust 	are grinding past each other<br> (blocks 2 and 3, blocks 1 and 3, and blocks 2 and 4). Although most transform faults<br> are located within the ocean basins, there are a 	few that cut through the continental<br> crust. An example of this is the San Andreas fault. The immediate concerns about<br> transform fault boundaries are earthquake 	activities triggered by movements along the<br> fault system.</p>

	<p class="text-title">Summary</p>
	<p class="normal-text">Plate tectonics is a scientific theory that explains how the Earth's outer layer is made up of several plates that move and interact with each 	other. The movement of these plates is responsible for many geological phenomena, such as earthquakes, volcanic activity, and the formation of mountain ranges.<br>
	The theory states that the Earth's lithosphere (which includes the crust and uppermost part of the mantle) is broken into several large plates that move on top of the 	underlying asthenosphere. The movement of these plates is driven by the convection currents in the mantle, which cause the plates to either move apart (divergent 	boundaries), collide (convergent boundaries), or slide past each other (transform boundaries).<br>
	Divergent boundaries are areas where two plates are moving apart, and new crust is being created through volcanic activity. Convergent boundaries occur where two plates 	are colliding, and one plate is subducted (pushed down) beneath the other, leading to the formation of mountains, earthquakes, and volcanic activity. Transform boundaries 	are areas where two plates are sliding past each other, leading to the formation of faults and earthquakes.<br>
	The theory of plate tectonics has revolutionized the field of geology and our understanding of the Earth's geological processes. It has helped scientists explain the 	distribution of earthquakes and volcanoes, the formation of ocean basins and mountain ranges, and the movement of continents over time. Plate tectonics is also important 	in predicting and understanding natural disasters, such as earthquakes and tsunamis.</p>
