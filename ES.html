	<p class="text-title"> The Electromagnetic Spectrum </p>
	<p class="text">The electromagnetic spectrum is a continuum of electromagnetic waves arranged<br> according to frequency and wavelength. It is a gradual progression
	from the<br> waves of lowest frequencies to the waves of highest frequencies. According to<br> increasing frequency, the EM spectrum includes: radio waves,
	microwaves,<br> infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays. These waves do<br> not have exact dividing region.</p>
	<img src="wave.gif" alt="Magnetic wave" class="wave">

	<p class="normal-text">&nbsp The electromagnetic spectrum is the range of all types of electromagnetic radiation. Electromagnetic radiation is a form of energy that 	travels through space at the speed of light, and it includes everything from radio waves to X-rays and gamma rays.

	The electromagnetic spectrum is typically divided into different regions based on the frequency or wavelength of the radiation. These regions include radio waves, 	microwaves, infrared radiation, visible light, ultraviolet radiation, X-rays, and gamma rays. Each region of the spectrum has its own unique properties and is used for a 	variety of purposes, from communication and entertainment to medical imaging and scientific research.

	Radio waves have the lowest frequency and the longest wavelength, while gamma rays have the highest frequency and the shortest wavelength. Visible light, which is the 	range of electromagnetic radiation that we can see with our eyes, falls in the middle of the spectrum, with a range of wavelengths between approximately 400 to 700 	nanometers.</p>

	<p class="text-title">Radio Waves</p>
	<p class="text">Radio waves have the longest wavelength in the electromagnetic spectrum. They are<br> produced by making electrons vibrate in an 	antenna. They are used to transmit<br> sound and picture information over long distances. Radio waves have a very wide<br> range of wavelengths. The 	whole region of the radio waves is divided into smaller<br> regions or wavebands. Each waveband is allocated by law to a specific radio service.<br> The 	wavelengths and frequencies of the different wavebands and their uses are shown<br> in Table 2.</p>

	<p class="normal-text">&nbspLow frequency waves are suitable for communication over great distances. But the curvature of the earth limits the range to about 80 kilometers. To extend the range, a repeater is used. The repeater receives the signal and re-transmits it to the receiving station. High frequency waves can be reflected by the ionosphere. This enables the waves to be transmitted over great distances.Medium and high frequency waves are used for broadcasting by local radio stations. In a radio station, sound is converted by a microphone into patterns of electric current variations called audio-frequency (AF) signals. High frequency radio waves called radio-frequency (RF) carriers can be modulated to match the electronic signal. In amplitude modulation, the amplitude of the radio waves (RF carrier) changes to match that of the audio-frequency signal. This is used in standard broadcasting because it can be sent over long distances. Very high frequency waves provide a higher quality broadcasting including stereo sound. In this process, instead of the amplitude of the RF carrier, it is the frequency of the waves that changes to match that of the signal. This is called frequency modulation.</p>
	
	<p class="text-title">Microwave</p>
	<p class="normal-text">Microwaves have smaller wavelengths than radio waves. They are used in satellite communications, radar, television transmission and cooking.</p>

	<p class="text-title">Application of Microwaves Satellite Communications</p>
	<p class="normal-text">Microwaves can penetrate the atmosphere of the earth. This is the reason why they are used for satellite communications. Communication satellites travel around the earth at an altitude of 35, 000 km above the equator. They move at a speed of 11 300 km/h and revolve around the earth every 24 hours, the same rate as the rotation of the earth. This makes them appear to be stationary when seen on Earth. Antennae are mounted to point in fixed directions towards these satellites. Microwaves signals are transmitted by an antenna to a satellite which amplifies and re-transmits the signal to an antenna in other parts of the world. This is how we communicate with the rest of the world.</p>
	<p class="normal-text">&nbspMicrowaves have short wavelengths and are reflected by small objects. This property is used in radars. Radar is the acronym of radio detection an ranging. A radar system is consists of an antenna, transmitter, and a receiver. The antenna whirls around continuously to scan the surrounding area. The transmitter sends out a narrow beam of microwaves in short pulses. A distant object reflects some of the signal back to the receiver. The direction to which the signal was received gives the direction of the object. The distance of the object can be calculated from the time lag between the transmitted pulse and the reflected pulse.</p>

	<p class="text-title">Terrestrial Communication</p>
	<p class="text">Microwaves are used to transmit television news coverage from mobile broadcast<br> vehicles back to the station. The news crew can also set up a small antenna to<br> send signals to a communication satellite. This is how news are broadcasted and<br> watched live around the world.</p>

	<p class="text-title">Microwave Oven</p>
	<p class="text">In a microwave oven, foods absorb certain microwave frequencies very strongly.<br> The microwaves penetrate the food being heated. It will agitate the water<br> molecules within the food, thus creating molecular friction which then produces<br> heat that will cook it.</p>
	<img src="oven.webp" alt="Microwave oven" class="oven">

	<p class="text-title">Infrared</p>
	<p class="normal-text">Infrared radiation lies beyond the red end of the visible light. It is emitted by all objects. The amount and wavelength of radiation depend on temperature. Below 500oC, an object emits only infrared radiation. Above 500oC, an object glows and emits both infrared and some visible light. Our bodies radiate infrared and under infrared camera or a night vision goggle, our images appear in variety of colors. The differences in color determine the differences in temperature. For example, shades of blue and green indicate regions of colder temperature; and red and yellow indicate warmer temperature.</p>

	<p class="text-title">The Visible Spectrum</p>
	<p class="normal-text">When white light passes through a prism, it is separated into its constituent colors: the red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet. These colors do not distinctly separate but they continuously change from red to violet. Red color has the longest wavelength from among these colors and violet has the shortest. Our eyes are sensitive to electromagnetic waves of wavelengths that ranges from 4x10-7 m to 7x10-7 m. This is the range of wavelengths of white light. Thus, the spectrum of white light is therefore called the visible spectrum. Table 3 shows the wavelengths of the different colors that constitute the white light.</p>

	<p class="text-title">Some Uses of UV Radiation</p>
	<p class="normal-text">The sun is our main source of ultraviolet radiation but there are also artificial sources of UV light. Ultraviolet radiation in UV lamps are used by
banks to check the signature on a passbook. The signature is marked on the passbook with fluorescent ink. It becomes visible when viewed under an ultraviolet lamp. These lamps are also used to identify fake banknotes. Ultraviolet radiation is also used in sterilizing water from drinking fountains. Some washing powder also contains fluorescent chemicals which glow in sunlight. This makes your shirt look whiter than white in daylight. Ultraviolet radiation in sunlight produces vitamin D in the skin and gives us tanning effect. But since UV rays have high energy, it could be harmful to some extent. It could burn the skin and hurt our eyes. Overexposure to UV radiation may cause skin cancer. Suntan or sunscreen lotions serve as filters to protect the body from ultraviolet radiation.</p>

	<p class="text-title">X-ray</p>
	<p class="text">X-rays come just after the ultraviolet rays. They are of shorter wavelength but<br> carries higher energy than the UV. X-rays are produced using an X-ray tube.<br> They are emitted when fast moving electrons hit a metal target. X-rays were<br> discovered by Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen in 1895. Long wavelength X-rays can<br> penetrate the flesh but not the bones. They are used in X-ray photography to<br> help doctors look inside the body. They are useful in diagnosing bone fractures<br> and tumors. Short wavelength X-rays can penetrate even through metals. They are<br> used in industry to inspect welded joints for faults. All X-rays are dangerous<br> because they can damage healthy living cells of the body. This is the reason why<br> frequent exposure to X-rays should be avoided. Too much exposure to X-rays can<br> damage body tissues and can cause cancer.</p>

	<p class="text-title">Gamma Rays</p>
	<p class="normal-text">Gamma rays lie at the other end of the electromagnetic spectrum. They are shortest in wavelength and highest in frequency. They carry the highest
amount of energy, thus, they are more dangerous. Gamma rays are emitted by stars and some radioactive substances. They can only be blocked with lead and thick concrete. Gamma rays are very strong that they can kill living cells. Gamma rays are used to treat cancer through the process called radiotherapy. They are also used for sterilization of drinking water.</p>
